Computer Logic and Organization is about knowing the computer concretely, representationally, un-abstracted. Computers are abstractions in our lives. We can see the computer, and we can see the components that realize a computer, but we can not see with our eyes the work of a computer. This course presents awareness of how a computer works atomically, all the way to, the lowest level of abstraction.
