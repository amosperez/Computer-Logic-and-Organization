# Computer-Logic-and-Organization
Computer Logic and Organization is about knowing the computer concretely, representationally, un-abstracted. Computers are abstractions in our lives. We can see the computer, and we can see the components that realize a computer, but we can not see with our eyes the work of a computer. This course presents awareness of how a computer works atomically, all the way to, the lowest level of abstraction.

# Student Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of CDA3103, students will...

- Gain a deep understanding of the overall organization and design of computers from both programmers’ and architects’ points of view.
- Learn to calculate binary values
- Create design specifications for hardware elements
- Produce assembly language code segments
- Identify elements of a datapath and their specific interactions
- Evaluate processor performance, and analyze memory behavior.
- Be capable of designing, modifying, and simulating a single-cycle data path and its control unit. In a final project, students will produce a functioning simulator of a reduced MIPS processor.

Imagine a bar graph that represents voltage level with a point in the middle. If the top of the bar is above the point, a 1 is produced. If the the top of the bar is below the point, a 0 is produced. Simple as that.

From there, we can calculate numerical arithmetic operations.
